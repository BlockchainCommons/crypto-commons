# Documents

Blockchain Commons has produced a variety of documentation of interest to developers and users of blockchains.

## The Crypto Commons

Our crypto-commons specifications, reference tools, and libraries offer new interoperable methodologies for cryptocurrency wallets, and may be of interest to developers and users.

### General

1. [Key Derivation Names](key-derivations.md)

### Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction (SSKR)

SSKRs allow a seed to be sharded into shares that can be stored as words, URs, or QRs.

1. [SSKR for Users](sskr-users.md)
   * [SSKR Cold Storage](sskr-cold-storage.md)
   * [SSKR Video Example](sskr-video.md)
1. [SSKR for Developers](sskr-developers.md)
   * [SSKR Test Vector](sskr-test-vector.md)

_For an even more comprehensive list, please see our [SSKR overview page](sskr-overview.md), which includes links to research papers, references, code, and other material from other repos, all intended to support your understanding of SSKR, whether you're a user, a power user, or a developer._

### Uniform Resources (URs)

URs allow for the interoperable transmission and storage of a variety of information, especially cryptographic data.

1. [URs: An Introduction](ur-1-overview.md)
   * [A Guide to Using URs for Key Material](ur-2-keys.md)
   * [A Guide to Using URs for SSKRs](ur-3-sskrs.md)
1. [A Guide to Using UR Request & Response](ur-99-request-response.md)
1. [crypto-request and crypto-response vs Signing via crypto-psbt](crypto-request-or-crypto-psbt.md)
1. [ur:crypto-request test vectors](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/crypto-request-test-vectors.md)
1. [ur:crypto-seed test vectors](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/crypto-seed-test-vectors.md)


_We also have a more comprehensive [UR overview page](ur-overview.md) that includes links to research papers, references, code, and other material of interest primarily to UR developers._

### Technology Overview Video

### Coming Soon

_We are planning one more UR article in the near future, detailing how to use URs with PSBTs._

_Please feel free to file an issue if there's more Crypto Commons specifications that you'd like to see with more extensive documents._

## #SmartCustody

#SmartCustody is an initiative meant to help users to safely manage their cryptocurrency and is focused on responsible key management.

## Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line

Learning Bitcoin is our classic course that introduces Bitcoin concepts and programming beginning with Bitcoin Core's command-line tools and its RPC interface.
