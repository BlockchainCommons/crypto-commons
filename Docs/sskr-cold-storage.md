# SSKR Cold Storage
###### tags: `article / in process`

[Smart Custody](https://www.smartcustody.com/), Blockchain Commons' 2019 guide to best practices for key management, suggests maintaining copies of keys etched in metal. Though SSKR can produced a much larger set of words, it can still be managed. Ken Sedgwick demonstrated one way to do so using dogtags and the [test vector](https://hackmd.io/6ffODXuOSIiTs0VdMesP-Q).

His complete method requires the following shopping list (with two different options for the military embossing machine):

The overall procedure is simple:

1. Print out your SSKR as a guide.
2. Optionally, print a [new sheet](https://gist.github.com/ksedgwic/ce28cedd58b40fdb6522c905c07655e4) to divide each SSKR into two parts.
3. Emboss each share onto a pair of tags using the machine.

You could stop there, but Ken suggests additional security:

4. Bolt each pair of tags against a blank tag to make them unreadable.
5. Dip each set of bolted tags in black plasti dip to bind them together.
6. Cover the edges of the dip with glitter to form a unique pattern that can't be replicated.
7. Photograph the patterns so that you can later test if the tags have been opened up.
