# UR Overview

UR stands for Uniform Resources, a method for encoding structured binary data in plain-text strings that are also well-formed URIs. It's an interoperability specification that allows for the reliable, typed transfer of data and was designed in particular to allow for reliable transmission of crypto-seeds, crypto-keys, PSBTs, and other data related to cryptocurrency.

One of the particular advantages of UR is careful integration with QR codes, a prime method for transmitting data across airgaps. URs are built to be efficient when encoded as QRs. In addition, multi-part URs allow for the creation of animated QRs, overall containing more information than any single QR could have.

Typed data, reliable interoperation, QR optimization, and animated QRs are the main reasons to use the UR specification.

## Intro

The following provides broad overviews of UR:

* [UR Technology Introduction](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md)

These videos offer overviews in a different format:

## For Users

As a user, you might note applications using URs of the format "ur:type/bytewords" (or a QR encoding that UR). These allow for the free movement of data among apps that support the UR specification. This will be mostly automated, typically requiring you to show a QR from one app to another.

Example UR:
```
ur:crypto-seed/oyadgdhkwzdtfthptokigtvwnnjsqzcxknsktdhpyljeda
```

The following iOS reference applications support the use of URs:

* [Gordian Seed Tool](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229) — imports and exports URs
